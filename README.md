# WEB
WEB Project which implements a moodle clone where you have students and teachers. 
Students can upload their projects. 
Teachers can download projects, put comments or grades. 
There is a search bar and a sort function for the projects. 

I implemented it to have a black background so its easier for the eyes, but the colors can easily be changed if that annoys someone.
